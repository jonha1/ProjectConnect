In Next.js the entry point file needs to be named "page.tsx"

Routing:
    - To have an about page -> create folder "about" in pages (needs to be lowercase) and add a page.tsx file
    - When linking href to another page, use same lowercase name as folder
    - Add to next.config.mjs the source of /about with destination of /pages/about
    
    GPT NOTES:
        - The .mjs extension in next.config.mjs specifies that the file is a module and uses ESM (ECMAScript Module) syntax
        - Uses "export default"

Layout.tsx:
    - sets up the layouts of the project -> import bootstrap there
